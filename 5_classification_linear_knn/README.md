# The fifth task of the ["Introduction to Machine Learning"](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/ml-intro/tree/2022/5_classification_linear_knn) RS School course

# Materials

- In order to get a general understanding, read [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://trevorhastie.github.io/ISLR/) chapter 4 up to section 4.3 inclusive. Dive into section 4.4 if you dare (optional).
- Review the related [sklearn facilities usage (logistic regression)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/justmarkham/DAT8/blob/master/notebooks/12_logistic_regression.ipynb).
- Study the [Classification section of the Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/video-lecture) (skip the Programming Exercise as it's not relevant for our course purposes).
- Read about [kNN](https://www.unite.ai/what-is-k-nearest-neighbors/).
- Review the [related sklearn facilities usage (KNN)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/justmarkham/DAT8/blob/master/notebooks/08_knn_sklearn.ipynb). 
- Read [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-5-classification-evaluation-metrics-you-must-know-aa97784ff226) for an extended overview of the ways to evaluate classification models.
- Read [Imbalanced classification approaches overview](https://machinelearningmastery.com/tactics-to-combat-imbalanced-classes-in-your-machine-learning-dataset/).
- *Optional*. Read [KNN notes](https://sebastianraschka.com/pdf/lecture-notes/stat479fs18/02_knn_notes.pdf) - KNN explanation including computational performance analysis.
